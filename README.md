# Problem Statement
A shopping mall is facing declining sales and revenue over the past few years even though the footfall hasn't reduced. It has been identified that this is mainly due to the  emergence of online shopping and the better shopping experiences it offers.

# Solution
Our solution covers four main aspects-
1. Influencing the shoppers to buy more.
2. Enhancing the shopper experience which has a major role to play while competing with online shopping.
3. Customers complained about walking a lot to get to the desired shops and not getting what they were looking for. Hence, the mall layout is optimised.
4. Maximisation of the Mall ROI.

# Analysis Approach

1. Shopper Ping Density Analysis to plot shopper's pings on the mall map and identify the different density zones. 
2. We envision a layout where stores belonging to the same category are clubbed together and placed within a designated region.
3. Analysis of category-specific visiting patterns for different time scales to identify time periods in which the popularity of different categories of shops is at its highest. We then recommend various solutions to leverage these findings.
4. PAM Clustering Analysis for segmenting customers into buckets based on their demographic information to achieve personalized targeting of customers.
