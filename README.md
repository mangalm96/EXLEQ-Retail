# Problem Statement
A shopping mall is facing declining sales and revenue over the past few years even though the footfall hasn't reduced. It has been dentified that this is mainly due to the  emergence of online shopping and the better shopping experiences it offers.

# Solution
Our solution covers three main aspects-
1. We recommend steps that can influence the shoppers to buy more 
2. Some of our recommendations deal with enhancing the shopper experience which has a major role to play while competing with online shopping
3. Customers complained about walking a lot to get to the desired shops and not getting what they were looking for.Hence, the mall layout is optimised
4. We tried maximising the ROI for the mall

# Analysis Approach

1. Shopper Ping Density Analysis to plot shopper's pings on the mall layout and identify the different density zones. 
2. We envision a layout where stores belonging to the same category are clubbed together and placed within a designated region.
3. Anlaysis of category specific visiting pattern bon different time scales to identify time periods in which popularity of different categories of shops is at its highest. We then recommend various solutions to leverage these findings.
4. PAM Clustering Analysis for segmenting customers into buckets based on their demographic information to achieve personalized targeting of cutomers.
